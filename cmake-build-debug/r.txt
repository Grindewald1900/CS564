Rap God - Eminem
Look I was gonna go easy on you and
not to hurt your feelings
But I’m only going to get this one chance
Something wrong I can feel it
Its just I feel it in my guts
Like something about to happen
but I don’t know what
If that mean what I think it means
were in trouble big trouble
And if he’s banana as you say
I’m not taking any chances
You’re just what the sound wants
I'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long
enough to slap box slap box
They said I rap like a robot so call me rapbot
But for me to rap like a computer
it’s must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pinnacle walk when I half cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and killing off it
Every since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut sacks
I’m a emcee still as honest but as rude
as indecent as hell all syllables
Killaholic kill em all with
This ligiti hibidi hibidi hip-hop you
don’t really want to get into it
Put with this back pack
and a mac in the back of the yak
back pack rat yap yap yap
Now at the exact same time I take
these lyrically acrobats stunts while I’m practicing
I’ll be able break a mother ****ing table
over the back of a couple of faggets and crack it in half
Tony realize he was ironic I was under aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow all I do is drop F bombs
Give him a wraithbatat rapper having a rough time period
Here is a maxi pad its actually disasterly bad
For the for the master leak destructing master p ass
I'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
Now who thinks their arms are
long enough to slap box slap box
Let me show you maintaining
that shit ain’t that hard that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secrets
to rapping mortality like I have god
Well to be truthful the blue prints
simply raging youthful exuberance
Everybody love the root of a nuisance
50 got up like an asteroid and did
nothing but shoot to the moon since “phew”
Emcee get taking to school
with this music cause I use it as a vehicle
To bust a rhyme got to lead a school of new students
Me I’m a product of Rakim Lakim 2pac N.

W.A Cube Ren Easy thank you they got slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
blow up and be in a position
To meet Run DMC and induct them to the mother****ing
Rock and roll hall of fame even though
I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only hall of fame I be inducted in is the
alcohol of fame on the wall of shame
You fags think it’s a game till I walk a flock of flames
Off of planking tell me what in the **** are you thinking
Little gay looking boy so gay
I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre like your watching
a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey that boy is gay that’s all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up pat on the back and
a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey looking boy what you say looking boy
I got a hell yeah from trey looking boy
I’mma work for everything
I have never asked nobody for shit
get outta my face looking boy
Basically boy you’re never gonna
be capable to be keeping up with the same pace looking boy
I'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
The way I’m racing around the track call me Nascar Nascar
There own heart of the trailer park the white trash god
Kneel before Generals Zod this planet
krypton no asgard asgard
So you be Thor and I’ll be Odin you rodent
I’m omnipotent
Let off then I’m reloading immediately with there bombs I’m toteing
And I should not be woken I’m walking dead but
I’m just a talking head a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I’m out my ramen noodle
We have nothing in common poodle
I’m a Doberman pinch yourself
in the arm and pay homage pupil
Its me my honesty’s brutal
But its honesty futile if I don’t utilize
that I do though
For good at least once in awhile
so I wanna make sure somewhere chicken scratch scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help
get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punch lines
Just in case cause even if you’re unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it’s lunchtime
I know there was a time where once
I was king of the underground but I still rap like
I’m on a pharaoh grind
So I crunch rhymes but sometimes
when you combine a pill with the skin color of mine
You get too big and since you like that one line
I said Mathers LP

When I tried take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in line add an AK-47 a revolver and one nine
See if I get away with it now then I ain’t as big as
I was but I’m morph into an immortal
Coming through the portal
But you’re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though and
I don’t know what the **** that you rhyme for
You’re pointless like Rapunzel with ****ing cornrolls

**** being normal
And I just bought a new ray gun
from the future to just come and shoot ya
Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
pick a fight Mayweather pants on the door
Man oh man that was a 24 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
Hey fab I’mma kill you lyrics coming at you
at super sonic speed (Ray J Fag)
Uh sama lama dama lama you assuming I’m a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I’m superhuman
Innovative made of rubber so anything you saying ricocheting off of me
never stating more than demonstrating how to
give a mother ****er feeling like he’s levitating
Never fading and I know that the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off they’d be celebrating
Cause I know that way to get ‘em motivated
I make elevating music you make elevator music

Oh he’s too mainstream well that’s what they doing jealous they confuse it
Its not hip hop its pop cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock shocked rap with Doc don’t to make them lose it
I don’t know how to make songs like that I don’t know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I’m ripping any one of these verses the verse is huge
inadvertently hurting you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
that if you’re half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too
School flunky pill junky but look at the accolades the skill brung me
Full of myself but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do that I put my mind to
And I’m a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues but its still tongue in cheek **** you
I’m drunk so Satan take the ****ing wheel I’m asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the boys still chunky but funky
But in my head there’s something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here’s what they want from me
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination

But **** it life’s handing you lemons make lemonade then
But if I cant batter other women how the **** am
I supposed to bake them a cake then
Don’t mistake it for satan
It’s a fatal mistake if you think I need to
be overseas to take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face don’t be a retard
Be a king think not why be a king when you can be a god
